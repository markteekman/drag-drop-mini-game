# Drag Drop Mini Game
Small demo of a drag and drop interface using JavaScript's PointerEvents, Node.cloneNode() and getBoundingClientRect(), where you can pick op the boxes and drop them in the dropzone. You can move them around in the dropzone and when you set the numbers in the right order, a small win screen will appear! This project is build using my own [New Game](https://github.com/markteekman/new-game) Gulp Build (feel free to use it!).
